/**
* Fizz Buzz
* 
* In this project, we're going to build FizzBuzz. It's a children's game where
* you count from 1 to 20. Easy, right? Here's the catch: instead of saying
* numbers divisible by 3, say "Fizz". And instead of saying numbers divisible
* by 5, say "Buzz". For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, say "FizzBuzz".
* 
* So the rules are:
* 		Any number divisible by 3 is replaced by the word fizz 
* 		Any number divisible by 5 is replaced by the word buzz. 
* 		Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 become fizzbuzz.
* 
* Print your results to the console, or using JOptionPane if you like.
* 
* If your code is correct, the output will be:
*  
* 1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
*
